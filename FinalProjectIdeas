For my final project, I am working with Shuvaethy. We are probably going to create a side-scrolling game on GUI. This will include 
jumping and moving, much like Super Mario or the game on Google Chrome which one plays online when internet is unavailable.
Instead of being able to freely move, the screen keeps scrolling, and the user must be able to successfully navigate the 
perils of the stage.
